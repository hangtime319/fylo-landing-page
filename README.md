# Fylo Landing Page

A responsive, multi-section landing page for a fictional file storage service, styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Description

This project is a solution to the "Fylo landing page" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The main objective was to build a complete, fully responsive landing page. This project is a great example of using a **utility-first CSS framework** to quickly style a web page by composing pre-defined classes directly in the HTML markup, which significantly speeds up the development process.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For creating the semantic structure of the page, including the different sections, headers, and form elements.
* **Tailwind CSS:** This project was styled entirely with Tailwind, a utility-first framework. Instead of writing custom CSS, styles were applied using Tailwind's extensive set of utility classes, which handle everything from layout (Flexbox, Grid) to colors, spacing, and typography.
* **JavaScript:** This is a static project, so no JavaScript was required for the layout or core functionality.

## Installation

This is a static frontend project, so you don't need any complex setup or to run a build process, as the CSS file is already compiled. To get a local copy, simply follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/hangtime319/fylo-landing-page.git](https://github.com/hangtime319/fylo-landing-page.git)
    ```
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the project.

## Usage

This project serves as a comprehensive showcase of a modern landing page built with a utility-first approach. It features:
* A hero section with a call to action.
* A section highlighting the service's key features.
* A testimonial section with user quotes.
* A sign-up form with a distinct call to action.

## Features

* **Utility-First Styling:** The entire UI is built using Tailwind's utility classes.
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout is optimized to look great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
* **Clean & Modern UI:** The design is sharp and professional, with a well-defined color scheme and clear typography.
* **Multi-Section Layout:** The page is divided into logical sections to guide the user.
